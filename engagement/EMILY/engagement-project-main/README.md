# User Engagement Project

Your final project for the class will incorporate deeper user engegement. The project should build upon many of the concepts learned throughout the class, incorporate some significant amount of interactivity, and storing and recalling data in a way that multiple users of the application can benefit from. _The focus of this project will be on engagement -- i.e. inviting members of the public to create or add to a dataset in some way._

For this project you may extend your story map or your dashboard, as long as you have some realistic addition of functionality that allows for user engagement. You may also start a new project.

## Timeline

- This project will take us through the end of the semester on **December 4**, when we will have project presentations.
- To help you with your timeline, here are some milestones:
  - **October 30**: Project proposal due
  - **November 6**: Initial wireframes due
  - **November 20**: Plan for completion
  - **December 4**: Project presentations

## Instructions

Fork this repository, and add your project code to it. When you are ready to submit your project, refer to the Submission Checklist below.

## Project Proposal

You proposal doesn't have to be deep. It should:
1.  Make clear who the user of your project is. This should be more specific that "the general public". Refer to the [18F Method Card on Personas](https://guides.18f.gov/methods/decide/personas/) or the Digtal.gov article on [Improving Customer Experience with Digital Personas](https://digital.gov/2017/06/20/improving-customer-experience-with-digital-personas/).
2. Describe what you'll be doing in your tool to meet your user's needs.
3. Describe any datasets that you will be working with, including any data that users will put in.

## Initial Wireframes

Use wireframes to show what your project or your new feature will look like. You can use any tool you like to create these wireframes. 

## Plan for Completion

Describe what you will need to do to complete your project. This should include a list of tasks that you will need to complete, and a timeline for when you will complete them. I suggest using a tool like GitHub Projects to list out and manage your tasks/issues.
